# Gary's Sandbox
### My sandbox for learning computer vision and machine learning basic concepts.
This repo was made so that I can learn and share the topics related to computer vision and machine learning. Check out the `notebooks` directory to see my work.

The images are pulled from [Pexel's](https://www.pexels.com/api/) API and saved into a JSON file.

The goal of this repo is to create a neural network that can correct identify dogs from multiple images.

My sandbox is running on AWS' free t2.micro EC2 instance. The Jupyter notebook, where I do all the work, is hosted on NGINX.
