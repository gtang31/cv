# Gary's Sandbox
### My sandbox for learning computer vision and machine learning basic concepts.
This repo was made so that I can learn and share the topics related to computer vision and machine learning. Check out the `notebooks` directory to see my work.
The goal of this repo is to create a neural network that can correct identify dogs from multiple images.
